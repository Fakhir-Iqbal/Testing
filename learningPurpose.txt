1: npm init -y //This command creates a package.json file, which keeps track of your project’s info and dependencies.
2: install library moggose ,express ,cors ,nodemon, JWT



why install mongoose ?
Mongoose: Helps you connect to a MongoDB database and work with your data easily.



why install express ?
Express: A web framework for Node.js that makes it easier to build web applications and handle API requests.



why install cors ?
CORS: Allows you to control which websites can access your server. This is important for security.



why install nodemon ?
Nodemon: Automatically restarts your server when you make changes to your code, so you don’t have to do it manually. 
(Note : if You edit .en file you should restart your terminal)...



why install JWT ?
JWT, or JSON Web Token, is a way to securely send information between two parties. It consists of three parts:

Header: Contains info about how the token is signed.
Payload: Holds the actual data, like user information.
Signature: Ensures the token hasn’t been tampered with.

JWTs are often used for user authentication, allowing a server to verify the identity of a user without needing to keep session data.



After installing the libraries, create a main file in your project’s root folder (like index.js). 
This file will start your server and set up everything you need for your app.
